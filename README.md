# Python Vanity Plates
A school project from 2017

## Instructions from Prof:

Create a MA DMV vanity plate program:

All characters must be letters or numbers (eg no spaces or punctuation marks).
Vanity plate must have a minimum of 2 characters, a maximum of 6 characters, and must begin with two letters. 
It cannot have letters and numbers intermixed (eg â€œMG53TD"), and any numbers must come at the end.
Lastly, the first number cannot be 0 (zero).

You are to write a program which will accept a plate request from the user.  Then, tells the user if the plate does or does not violate the rules above, and which rule (just the first one if more than one) the request violates.
